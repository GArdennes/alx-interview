# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. This project not only tests your ability to manipulate 2D matrices but also challenges you to think about optimizing your solution to operate in-place, thus improving their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills in Python.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3`
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A readme file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style.
- You are not allowed to import any module.
- All modules and functions must be documented.
- All your files must be executable.


## Task
cd alx-interview
mkdir 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
cd 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
vi README.md


### 0. Rotate 2D Matrix
Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

**Requirements**
- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place
- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty
